# My tool to register for meetup 

This is my helper script for meetup.com API v2.

Unfortunately, meetup.com was bought by cash-strapped WeWork and new owner immediately switched API access from free to premium feature. Whilst doing so, they switched API from v2 to v3. 

I'll just leave it here to look back in 10 years and cringe a little. I do not expect to update this until meetup.com API becomes free again.
